# ETL-Pipeline-for-Crime-Data

Welcome to my ETL pipeline for Crime Data Project Repository!
This portfolio project is my second iteration of collecting and predicting Trinidad and Tobago's crime data. 
Since the initial project, I've decided that I'll continue to interate this topic through yearly projects. With each new addition, the aim is to display what i've learned since the last iterations.

As a Data Analyst, the ETL process is essential to understand and execute.
